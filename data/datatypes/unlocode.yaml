doc: N/LOCODE, the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations, is a geographic
  coding scheme developed and maintained by United Nations Economic Commission for
  Europe (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in trade and transport
  with functions such as seaports, rail and road terminals, airports, Postal Exchange
  Office and border crossing points. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000
  locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.
