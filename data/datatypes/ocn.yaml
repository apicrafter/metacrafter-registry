doc: OCLC assigns a unique control number (referred to as an "OCN" for "OCLC Control
  Number") to each new bibliographic record in the WorldCat. Numbers are assigned
  serially, and as of mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created. In September
  2013, the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain, removing a perceived
  barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself.[42] The control numbers link
  WorldCat's records to local library system records by providing a common reference
  key for a record across libraries
