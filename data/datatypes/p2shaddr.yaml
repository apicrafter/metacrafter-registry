doc: 'Pay to script hash (P2SH) transactions were standardised in BIP 16. They allow
  transactions to be sent to a script hash (address starting with 3) instead of a
  public key hash (addresses starting with 1). To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, the
  recipient must provide a script matching the script hash and data which makes the
  script evaluate to true. '
