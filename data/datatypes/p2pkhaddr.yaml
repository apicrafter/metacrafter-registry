doc: 'A Bitcoin address is only a hash, so the sender can''t provide a full public
  key in scriptPubKey. When redeeming coins that have been sent to a Bitcoin address,
  the recipient provides both the signature and the public key. The script verifies
  that the provided public key does hash to the hash in scriptPubKey, and then it
  also checks the signature against the public key. '
